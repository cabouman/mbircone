System matrix: disk / compute / compute and store as variable

Use swapaxes to make arrays correct shape

Optional:
center_offset (distance between detector center and center of beam) default [0, 0] ALU
rotation_offset (distance between object center and axis of rotatation) default [0] ALU
delta_pixel_detector, (default: 1ALU)
delta_pixel_image, (default: 1ALU/magnification)

Divide params into groups (required, optional, internal)
