API Reference
=============

* cone3D_ includes functions for 3D conebeam tomographic projection and reconstruction
  as well as some helper functions.
* phantom_ includes functions to generate 2D and 3D phantoms and an nrmse utility.
* preprocess_ includes functions for sinogram preprocessing and parameters parsing for both 3D and 4D conebeam datasets.
* mace_ includes functions for multi-slice MACE reconstruction of both 3D and 4D conebeam tomography.
* multinode_ includes functions for easily deployment on multi-nodes with Dask, a flexible library for parallel computing in Python.
* laminography_ includes functions for 3D parallel beam laminographic projection and reconstruction.
* utils_ includes utility functions to read and write image data.
